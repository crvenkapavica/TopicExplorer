# TopicExplorer
TopicExplorer Unity App using streaming.DataAssetsPath. This doesn't work on all devices since you can't write to that path on some API versions.
Please check both versions (the other one being in the second branch). That version should work on all APIs and is updated.
The only reason why it's not merged is so both versions can be seen, since the requiremented hinted at using streaming.DataAssetsPath.
